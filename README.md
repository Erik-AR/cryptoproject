# cryptoproject
### The goal of this project is to apply sentiment analysis on tweets that influence the trading of cryptocurrencies. Code is hardcoded to gather twitter data for bitcoin using keywords, but that can be easily modified to support other coins. 

## Justification
### Cryptocurrencies have been on the rise for the past years. Their value is completely defined by speculation of how much they can be worth. As such their exchange rates are very volatile, and very unpredictable.

### Twitter is one of the most popular social media networks there is, and it's an outlet through which millions of people broadcast their thoughts, fears and opinions on any topic of their interest.

### The goal of this project is to determine if we can use sentiment analyzer for this publicly available data that can help predict the data.
